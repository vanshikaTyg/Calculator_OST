# Calculator_OST

## Description
This Python-based calculator is designed for third-year students, providing functionalities beyond basic arithmetic. It supports trigonometric functions, logarithms, and matrix operations using NumPy.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division
- **Trigonometric Functions**: Sine, Cosine, and Tangent
- **Logarithmic Calculation**: Natural logarithm (ln)
- **Matrix Operations**: Addition and Multiplication

## Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You also need NumPy for matrix operations:
```sh
pip install numpy
```

## Usage

4. Division
Enter choice (1/2/3/4): 1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Result: 15
```

### Trigonometric Calculation:
```
Select function:
1. Sine
2. Cosine
3. Tangent
Enter choice (1/2/3): 1
Enter angle in degrees: 30
